# crowdControl
### or the recovery of a lost, badly built and poorly engineerized music graduation project

Inspired by Coldplay's [Xyloband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xyloband), crowdControl is a project that wants to give the opportunity to control the mobile devices of a crowd attending a concert, changing the color of the screen and triggering audio samples loaded into a web app controlled by the performer through MIDI protocol.
At the moment this repo contains the untouched files of the original project, the goal is to recover them, reengineering the whole project, do an heavy refactor and eventually improve the user experience.
